These records will include the judgments of a panel of 8 experts, and also the judgments of a varying number of people who are associated with the medical field, but not necessarily experts in the subject matter - this latter being our 'crowdsource' group. The crowdsourced judgments were gathered via an app available to people who work in medical professions or are students in medical school."
